# YouTube Comment Sentiment Analysis

This is my YouTube Comment Sentiment Analysis project. It's a Streamlit-based web browser application written in Python. The application takes a YouTube video URL, extracts the video's comments into a JSON file using the Google Cloud API, analyzes the comments using a Hugging Face sentiment analysis AI model, and presents the results.
