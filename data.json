Every heavy winter that comes along all the buildings that have roof collapses are the ones with that truss crap. Otherwise very informative video \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb",

        "comment": "Very interesting. Here in Australia our timber framed homes use pretty much all the same terminology the only difference is really when it comes to sheathing the house. We generally do not &#39;sheath&#39; the whole house in ply board prior to wrapping. We usually install what is called bracing ply in key locations (designated by the engineering) around the house to brace it up and stop movement. We also install cyclone rods which is threaded rod that extends from the foundation to the top plate which assists in holding the roof down during high winds. Furthermore generally all framing in the house is treated timber, not just the mud sill, this helps prevent rot and termites as the houses are generally built to breath not insulate.",
